Before starting the Journey , we need few things.

Install python (any version. Mine was 3.5)
Install PIP installer (If you don't know how to install pip PING me at "omnityblog.weebly.com"  or else there is a thread in stack overflow)
PIP install nltk (Or download and install , preferably PIP install)

That's all we are good to go.
